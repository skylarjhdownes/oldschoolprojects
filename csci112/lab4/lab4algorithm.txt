First, check if x is zero. if it is not, check if y is zero.  If it is not, check if x is positive. If so, check if y is positive. if y is positive, return Q1, if it is not, return Q4.  If x is not positive, check if y is positive.  If so, return Q2.  If not return Q3.  If y is zero return that the point is on the y axis.  If x is zero, check if y is zero.  If it isn't, return that the point is on the x axis.  If it is, return that the point is at the origin.
